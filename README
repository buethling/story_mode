Welcome to StoryMode!

StoryMode is a collaborative story writing tool. You can use StoryMode to continue the epic story from your favorite Pen & Paper RPG when you are between sessions, to collaboratively create a brand new story of heros and villians with your friends or family or come up with some other creative way to use it!


Features:

Take Turns
StoryMode is turn-based so you won't get lost in a pile of back-logs and miss out on the story. Don't have anything to say on this turn? You can pass to the next person and say your piece next time around.

Privacy
StoryMode allows you to make your story private, meaning it won't show up in searches or the story page. You'll have to send the link to a friend so they can join the story. Public stories on the other hand will show up in both and possibly be seen even by people who do not have an account.
